1. Access/publish data via web service (amazon) - SUZEE

2. Implement faceted search with mouse event

	-FACETS
		-Hide markers/Layer control (toggle layers) - XUN
		-filter based on attributes
		
		
	-MOUSE EVENTS
		-Click = zoom to layer or alert or just click map for latlon - SAMEER
		-Hover = highlight, window with attribytes
			L.control
			info.update
		
	
3. Change marker symbology (3 different facilities and transport.)	

JUST A MAYBE:

-filter by proximity to transportaion
-maybe add user input address, and route between metro/bus stops
-Add county boundary to map
-facet filter by zip code
